# To Do List

- [ ] feature descendants relation
- [ ] feature ancestors relation
- [ ] add `Tree` iterable class that has `NodeCollection` nodes on each level
- [ ] add `siblings` read-only relation.
- [ ] add `MySQL` driver support (based on `LIKE` operator).
- [ ] add possibility to generate a whole tree using model factory. develop API to specify how many nodes should be created per a depth level / make it dynamic using callable syntax. probably use sequences.
- [ ] add possibility to restrict max depth level.
- [ ] add docs about `read-only` relations (descendants and ancestors). use `parent` and `children` for saving nodes.
- [ ] add missing methods and helpers.
